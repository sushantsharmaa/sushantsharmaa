### MY STORY

THE BEGINNING

Everything started when I was in college. I started to create websites to earn some pocket money. The main idea was to get lots of visitors to click ads and to get paid. Time goes by and for many months I didn't think much about websites but the seed was there.

THE RISE

The second big thing for my career was when I decided to join Masai School and kick start my career in the IT Sector. I already knew some HTML & CSS but I didn't know much about how to make sites dynamic and alive. In that course, I started to really learn to program and soon I noticed that anything could be possible.

ENHANCING SKILLS

The third really big thing for my career and learning was projects. Projects give you insight into every stage of the development process. You'll even have to decide which tools or services you want to use and what kind of resources you need. This is one of the best ways to get exposure to a broad range of skills. When you get into a professional setting, you'll know a little about how everything works on top of your specialty.

AFTERWORD

Nowadays, I am working as a front-end web developer at Ottermap. It is a product-based company. We have a remarkable product to serve the companies which work in the Landscaping Industry in the USA. It is again a great opportunity to learn more and to gain knowledge about different technology stacks.
